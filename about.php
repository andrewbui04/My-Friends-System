  <ul>
    <li>I have done all the parts of this assignment also the extra challenges.</li>
    <li>I have tried my best to create css for my website in order to enhance the users' experience.</li>
    <li>To be honest, at the first time I have some difficulties with calculating a number of mutual friends. However, i finally attempted to do that part completely thanks to my friend's support when we met in person at school.</li>
    <li>In the next time, I wish I would optimize the SQL query by some techniques such as indexing if table has many records and also master the way of using oop style to develop some functions. And I also want to add some additional features such as search and filter.</li>
    <li>I did not add any additional features to this assignment.</li>
  </ul>
  <br><br>
  <p>I have not posted anything related to Discussion part on Canvas since at the period of time I was doing this assignment, i did not have any questions.</p>
